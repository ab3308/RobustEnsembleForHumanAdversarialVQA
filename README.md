# Ensemble for human-adversarial VQA
Code for my third year university project, "Towards robustness in human-adversarial visual question answering". This was my first exposure to and exploration with respect to multimodal models and training large scale machine learning models. Hence, the code is a little rusty.

All training took place on the [Jade HPC](https://www.jade.ac.uk/), hosted at the Hartree centre.
